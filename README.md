In this project we outlined a plan for the design and manufacturing of our capstone innovation. The “Spider Brace” was proposed to mitigate risks involved with spinal fusion procedures. We created an extensive report which includes a plethora of information regarding the product proposed, and why it can successfully fulfill both a national and global market need. Each subsystem of the design is discussed in depth, as well as similar products this design is based off of. In the future, verification and validation of the product’s ability to fulfill market needs still needs to be done, and the product needs to be pushed through the FDA regulation process. However, this product will be instrumental in alleviating the chance of pedicle breaches patients may suffer under current spinal fusion surgery procedures, and will reduce the liability surgeons may suffer as a result. 

The Python program here was designed to create an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for the surgeon to easily input the coordinates of the Spinous Process, and the two pedicles on the verbebra of interest. Once found, the program is able to use linear algebra and vector manipulation techniques to define the trajectory of the screw needed for optimal screw placement, and the orientation the device must be placed on the vertebra to ensure this trajectory is achieved.
